# My Favorite Movie
**Forest Gump**
> In 1994, when 'Forrest Gump' topped the box office and had six Oscar nominations, the film communicated messages of traditional values such as patriotism, capitalism and family ties. Whereas now the movie serves as a reminder to never give up when you end up bringing bad circumstances.
